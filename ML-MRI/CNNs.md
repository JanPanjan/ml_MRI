CNN or convolutional neural network are neural networks, primarily based on shift-invariant convolutional layers, where the trainable parameters are a set of convolutional kernels which are translated along the image dimensions in a sliding window.

They have some properties, that make them suitable for image processing, for example the ability to encode local relationships.
