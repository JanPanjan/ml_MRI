Anomalies/distortions apparent during visual representation. In information science, it's any **undesired** or **unintended alteration in data** introduced in a digital process by an involved technique or technology.

An artifact is an apparent structural detail that is caused by the processing of the specimen and is not a legitemate feature of the specimen.

In MRI they can be classified as patient-related, signal-processing-dependent or hardware (machine)-related.
